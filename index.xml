That's when Rohan's mom decided to put him in piano classes; he was not happy about that. But over the years, Rohan grew to love music. Then Noah started learning guitar, and Shaan started learning drums.</description></item><item><title>Noah</title><link>http://swami3.com/noah/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:42:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://swami3.com/noah/</guid><description>body { text-align: center; background-color: gold; } #head { font-size: 35px; } #aboutnoah { text-align: left; } Noah is the guitarist in the Swami 3. He started playing the classical guitar when he was 5, and practiced for 30 minutes a day. Before long he had learned a variety of songs; some electric/rock, and some classical. When he was 7, he learned to play with his brothers as a band.</description></item><item><title>Rohan</title><link>http://swami3.com/rohan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:42:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://swami3.com/rohan/</guid><description>body { text-align: center; background-color: darkred; } #aboutrohan { text-align: left; } Rohan started playing the piano at the age of five, and he started out reluctant. Over time, not only did he learn more and more complicated songs, but he also developed an ability to understand and play a song just by listening to it, as well as some partly-formed perfect pitch. He is currently a twelve-year-old seventh grader and is still learning more and more, every day.</description></item><item><title>Shaan</title><link>http://swami3.com/shaan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:42:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://swami3.com/shaan/</guid><description>body { background-color: blue; color: white; } #head { font-size: 35px; } #aboutshaan { text-align: left; } .shaanlink { color: white; } .shaanlink:hover { color: orange; } My name is Shaan. I am 10 years old and play the drums and sing. I started learning drums and vocals when I was 5, when our parents thought we should learn music and chose instruments for us that fit our personalities.</description></item><item><title>Songs</title><link>http://swami3.com/songs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:42:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://swami3.com/songs/</guid><description>body { background-color: darkred; } #sec1, #sec3, #sec5 { background-color: gold; } Latest Releases Don't Stop Me Now by Queen Merry Xmas Everybody by Slade Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen Soul Killing by The Ting Tings I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor American Pie by Don McLean That Thing You Do by The Wonders Come Together by The Beatles 12 Bar Blues by Jack Butwell Magic by Coldplay Imagine by John Lennon Lady Madonna by the Beatles Winter Wonderland by Michael Bubble Hall of Fame by The Script (feat.</description></item><item><title>Teacher Phil Surtees</title><link>http://swami3.com/phil/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:42:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://swami3.com/phil/</guid><description>#head { font-size: 35px; } .phillink { text-decoration: none; } .phillink:hover { text-decoration: underline; } #aboutphil { text-align: left; } Phil got his start in youth as first clarinet at the City of Birmingham Wind Orchestra, and later joined the Midland Youth Jazz Orchestra.
