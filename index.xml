He started playing the classical guitar when he was 5, and practiced for 30 minutes a day. Before long he had learned a variety of songs; some electric/rock, and some classical. When he was 7, he learned to play with his brothers as a band.</description></item><item><title>Rohan</title><link>http://swami3.com/rohan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:42:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://swami3.com/rohan/</guid><description>body { text-align: center; background-color: #c90404; } #aboutrohan { text-align: left; } #sec1, #sec3, #sec5 { background-color: gold; } Ever since Rohan reluctantly started learning piano at age 5, it has become his greatest passion. He started out following the Faber lesson books - but that only lasted him a few years. Once he finished all five levels of the books and was ready to move on, his teacher started giving him all sorts of new pieces to learn, including classical pieces, recent music, band pieces to play with his brothers (of course), and jazz sheets where he has opportunities to improvise.</description></item><item><title>Shaan</title><link>http://swami3.com/shaan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:42:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://swami3.com/shaan/</guid><description>body { background-color: blue; color: white; } #head { font-size: 35px; } #aboutshaan { text-align: left; } .shaanlink { color: white; } .shaanlink:hover { color: orange; } #sec1, #sec3 { background-color: gold; } My name is Shaan. I am 12 years old and play the drums and sing.

That's when Rohan's mom decided to put him in piano classes; he was not happy about that. But over the years, Rohan grew to love music. Then Noah started learning guitar, and Shaan started learning drums. The Swaminathans had a small electric keyboard in their house, Shaan got a shiny blue drum set for Christmas, and Noah had already been moving through a lot of guitars.</description></item></channel></rss>
