        When Rohan was five, the family walked past Russo Music in San Francisco. That's when
        Rohan's mom decided to put him in piano classes; he was <i>not</i> happy about that. But over the years, Rohan
        grew to love music. Then Noah started learning guitar, and Shaan started learning drums. The Swaminathans had a
        small electric keyboard in their house, Shaan got a shiny blue drum set for Christmas, and Noah had already been
        moving through a lot of guitars. When Rohan was seven and the twins were five, the family of five moved to a
        bigger house in another part of the city, and their new teacher, Phil Surtees, started coming home to teach. By then
        they had a full baby grand piano, and everybody's skills started to excel. Soon Noah and Shaan both had electric
        instruments, and they realized it was time to form a band. They started out slow; teacher Phil had fully
        simplified all the songs they worked on together to make it easier for them to coordinate. Soon they started
        learning more and more complex songs and in 2017, they held their first concert at St. Aidan's Episcopal Church,
        with lots of friends and family there to watch. They only played one group song: The Rose by Amanda McBroom. But
        the next year they had another concert at the same church, and this time they played three band songs: Drive My
        Car, Let It Be, and American Pie. After that, things went nuts. COVID struck the U.S., forcing them to stay at
        home. But they didn't see this as a challenge; they saw this as an opportunity. They had an "April Challenge",
        where friends and family could recommend songs for them to learn on their own, without any help from the teacher
        (they had already gotten that good)! They learned about 15 songs during that time, and recorded them all. In
        June 2020, they moved to Singapore because of their dad's work, and had a blast playing their songs for new
        friends! Two years later, in June 2022, the family returned home to SF and the Swami 3 are still adding new
        songs to their repitoire. What's next?
