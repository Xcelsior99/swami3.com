            Noah, Shaan's twin, is the guitarist in the Swami 3. He started playing the classical guitar when he was 5,
            and practiced for 30 minutes a day. Before long he had learned a variety of songs; some electric/rock, and
            some classical. When he was 7, he learned to play with his brothers as a band. Before their second concert
            in 2018, Noah got an electric guitar, but he didn't have enough time to get good enough to actually play it
            during the concert. But that didn't stop him. In 2019, he started to learn a new song to play with Rohan and
            Shaan, Bohemian Rhapsody. He was able to finish learning the song within 3-4 months, and he played it with
            his brothers on the electric. Noah is still learning new songs every day. On his electric guitar he is
            learning 'Miserlou' by Dick Dale, and on his classical guitar he's recently learned 'Fast Car' by Tracy
            Chapman and is now learning 'Tears in Heaven' by Eric Clapton. The songs he's learning are becoming more and
            more complicated and difficult. This is how Noah's music life has been so far....
