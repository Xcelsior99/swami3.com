            Noah is the guitarist in the Swami 3. He started playing the classical guitar when he was 5, and
            practiced for 30 minutes a day. Before long he had learned a variety of songs; some electric/rock,
            and some classical. When he was 7, he learned to play with his brothers as a band. Before their
            second concert in 2018, Noah got an electric guitar, but he didn’t have enough time to get good
            enough to actually play it during the concert. But that didn't stop him. In 2019, he started to
            learn a new song to play with Rohan and Shaan, Bohemian Rhapsody. He was able to finish learning the
            song within 3-4 months, and he played it with his brothers on the electric. Noah is still learning
            new songs every day. On his electric guitar he learned a song called ‘Purple Haze’ by guitar legend
            Jimi Hendrix, and on his classical guitar he is learning a song called ‘Ancestral Bells’. The songs
            he's learning are becoming more and more complicated and difficult. This is how Noah’s music life
            has been so far...
