        <p>
            My name is Shaan. I am 11 years old and play the drums and sing. I started learning drums and vocals
            when I was 5, when our parents thought we should learn music and chose instruments for us that fit
            our personalities. All the singing started when I was sitting in the car, singing along with the
            song playing from my mom's phone, and she said she would put me in the chorus. At first I was mad
            and reluctant, but eventually grew to like it. I joined the San Francisco Boys Chorus (<a
                href="https://www.sfbc.org/sfbc/" class="shaanlink" target="_blank">SFBC</a>) in January 2016
            and was promoted to their Intermediate Collegium level in just 3.5 years. In December 2018 I was
            selected to sing a solo with the world-famous <a href="https://www.chanticleer.org"
                class="shaanlink" target="_blank">Chanticleer</a> men's acapella group in a winter concert. I
            also got the opportunity to perform the National Anthem both at an Oakland A's game and a Golden
            State Warriors game (you can see that performance <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8N_NJTR5BQ&feature=youtu.be" class="shaanlink"
                target="_blank">here</a>). Finally, I was chosen to sing with other kids in the SF Opera's
            production of <a href="http://archive.sfopera.com/qry1operaview_l.asp?key=2057" class="shaanlink"
                target="_blank">Hansel & Gretel</a> in November 2019. Sadly, I had to leave the SFBC when we
            moved to Singapore, but I am very excited to have been accepted to the <a
                href="https://www.voicesofsingapore.com/childrenschoir" class="shaanlink" target="_blank">Voices
                of Singapore</a> Childrens' Choir starting in January 2021. I cannot wait to see what I get to
            do with them. Meanwhile, I have become very good at singing while drumming, and play an important
            role in our band.
