        <p>
            Phil got his start in youth as first clarinet at the City of Birmingham Wind Orchestra, and later
            joined the Midland Youth Jazz Orchestra. Following his degree in Music and Performing Arts he toured
            the UK and Europe with pop-ska band 'The Bad Robots' and indie-electro band 'Dead on Tv'. These
            days, as well as teaching, he is a freelance composer, songwriter and producer working with
            theatres, studios and publishers here and in the UK. He is trained in saxophone, clarinet, guitar
            and piano (and teaches drums in a pinch).
