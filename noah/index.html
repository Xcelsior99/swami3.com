He started playing the classical guitar when he was 5, and
practiced for 30 minutes a day. Before long he had learned a variety of songs; some electric/rock,
and some classical. When he was 7, he learned to play with his brothers as a band. Before their
second concert in 2018, Noah got an electric guitar, but he didn’t have enough time to get good
enough to actually play it during the concert. But that didn't stop him. In 2019, he started to
learn a new song to play with Rohan and Shaan, Bohemian Rhapsody. He was able to finish learning the
song within 3-4 months, and he played it with his brothers on the electric. Noah is still learning
new songs every day. On his electric guitar he learned a song called ‘Purple Haze’ by guitar legend
Jimi Hendrix, and on his classical guitar he is learning a song called ‘Ancestral Bells’. The songs
he's learning are becoming more and more complicated and difficult. This is how Noah’s music life
has been so far...</p><p>Hobbies:</p><ul><li>Sports (basketball, skiing, tennis)</li><li>Coding</li><li>Guitar (of course)</li></ul><p>Favorite food: veggie burger</p><p>Favorite color: yellow</p></div></div><br><div class=individuals><div id=ind-song-head><h3>Songs</h3></div><div id=noahsong><div id=sec1 class=sec><div id=malaguena class=songDiv><h4>Malagueña by Paco de Lucía</h4><iframe class=song width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5YzNiQP1To frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div id=sherryswaltz class=songDiv><h4>Sherry's Waltz by York</h4><iframe class=song width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ikz3U3--uNM frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div></div></article><script>var dropbtn=document.getElementById('dropbtn')
