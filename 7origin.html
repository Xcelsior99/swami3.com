                Rohan, Shaan, and Noah all got into music around the age of five. Rohan started on the piano, Shaan on the
                drums, and Noah on the guitar. Before long they had all gotten fairly good, and started to play songs
                together. At first, it was just cute. The first song they learned was The Rose by Amanda McBroom. They had a
                short concert at a church in San Francisco that consisted mostly of their individual songs, but saved The
                Rose for their grand finale. After that, it got more serious. Their second concert was in 2018, in which
                they played three songs together: Drive My Car (Beatles), Let it Be (also Beatles), and finally American Pie
                (Don McLean). Of course, they played some of their individual songs in between. They even wore bright red
                suits (as you might have noticed in the video on the "Concerts" page)! After that, they were all so talented
                that they could practically figure out how to play any song as a band. When COVID hit, they did an "April
                Challenge" where friends could recommend any song for them to play. Shaan was able to figure out the beat
                for the drums, and Rohan was able to figure out the chord patterns and add melody. Rohan used his book of
                blank sheet music to write the music for Noah to play, and he was able to learn that quickly. With this
                routine, they learned about half of the recommended songs and took videos to share with the friends who
                recommended them. What was especially exciting was when Gloria Gaynor replied (with lots of emojis) to their
                dad's Instagram post with a video of the Swami 3 playing I Will Survive. The same thing happened with a
                English pop duo, the Ting Tings, who were very impressed with how they played Soul Killing. In June,
                the Swami 3 and their parents all moved to Singapore because of work, and they are still making beautiful
                music every day. What's next?
